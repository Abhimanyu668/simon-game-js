# Simon Game
**Simon Game** is a simple memory-based game that challenges your pattern-recognition skills. The game displays a series of tiles in a specific sequence, and your task is to click on the tiles in the same order. As you progress through the levels, the patterns become more complex, testing your memory and attention.
